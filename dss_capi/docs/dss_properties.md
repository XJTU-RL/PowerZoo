# DSS-Extensions: OpenDSS Commands and Properties


**This document was generated from:** `DSS C-API Library version 0.10.7 revision 47422ccbb833c89de64d8941c520d106c9e7d0d4 based on OpenDSS SVN 2963 (v7/classic variation) MVMULT [FPC 3.2.0] (64-bit build)`

*Generated with the legacy models disabled (i.e. OpenDSS v9+ compatibility mode).*

## About this

This is a document automatically generated from the commands, options and properties for the DSS language (script level) exposed in the DSS-Extensions version of the OpenDSS engine. A separate document will be developed in the future to detail **API** functions and general usage recommendations for the projects under DSS-Extensions.

Since the extensive majority of properties and elements are compatible, this document can be useful when using either the official OpenDSS implementation or the DSS-Extensions version (DSS C-API engine), consumed through the projects DSS-Python (`dss_python`), OpenDSSDirect.py, OpenDSSDirect.jl, DSS Sharp (`dss_sharp`), and DSS MATLAB (`dss_matlab`).  If you are using the official OpenDSS, when in doubt check the official documentation and/or source code.

As a final note, keep in mind that not all commands are implemented in the DSS-Extensions engine, interactive commands like plots are missing (on purpose).

| %mean | Percent mean to use for global load multiplier. Default is 65%. |
| %Normal | Sets the Normal rating of all lines to a specified percent of the emergency rating.  Note: This action takes place immediately. Only the in-memory value is changed for the duration of the run. |
| %stddev | Percent Standard deviation to use for global load multiplier. Default is 9%. |
| Addtype | {Generator \| Capacitor} Default is Generator. Type of device for AutoAdd Mode. |
| Algorithm | {Normal \| Newton}  Solution algorithm type.  Normal is a fixed point iteration that is a little quicker than the Newton iteration.  Normal is adequate for most radial distribution circuits.  Newton is more robust for circuits that are difficult to solve. |
| Allocationfactors | Sets the connected kVA allocation factors for all loads in the active circuit to the value given. |
| Allowduplicates | {YES/TRUE \| NO/FALSE}   Default is No. Flag to indicate if it is OK to have devices of same name in the same class. If No, then a New command is treated as an Edit command. If Yes, then a New command will always result in a device being added. |
| Autobuslist | Array of bus names to include in AutoAdd searches. Or, you can specify a text file holding the names, one to a line, by using the syntax (file=filename) instead of the actual array elements. Default is null, which results in the program using either the buses in the EnergyMeter object zones or, if no EnergyMeters, all the buses, which can make for lengthy solution times. <br><br>Examples:<br><br>Set autobuslist=(bus1, bus2, bus3, ... )<br>Set autobuslist=(file=buslist.txt) |
| Basefrequency | Default = 60. Set the fundamental frequency for harmonic solution and the default base frequency for all impedance quantities. Side effect: also changes the value of the solution frequency. Saved as default for next circuit. |
| Bus | Set Active Bus by name.  Can also be done with Select and SetkVBase commands and the "Set Terminal="  option. The bus connected to the active terminal becomes the active bus. See Zsc and Zsc012 commands. |
| CapkVAR | Size of capacitor, kVAR, to automatically add to system.  Default is 600.0. |
| CapMarkerCode | Numeric marker code (0..47 -- see Users Manual) for Capacitors. Default is 38. |

| Cfactors | Sets the CFactors for for all loads in the active circuit to the value given. |
| circuit | Set the active circuit by name. |
| Cktmodel | {Multiphase \| Positive}  Default = Multiphase.  Designates whether circuit model is to interpreted as a normal multi-phase model or a positive-sequence only model |

Trapezoidal is more accurate when there are sharp changes in a load shape or unequal intervals. Trapezoidal is automatically used for some load-duration curve simulations where the interval size varies considerably. Keep in mind that for Trapezoidal, you have to solve one more point than the number of intervals. That is, to do a Daily simulation on a 24-hr load shape, you would set Number=25 to force a solution at the first point again to establish the last (24th) interval.<br><br>Note: Set Mode= resets Trapezoidal to No/False.

Enter an array of the legal voltage bases, in phase-to-phase voltages, for example:<br><br>set voltagebases=".208, .480, 12.47, 24.9, 34.5, 115.0, 230.0" <br><br>When the CalcVoltageBases command is issued, a snapshot solution is performed with no load injections and the bus base voltage is set to the nearest legal voltage base. The defaults are as shown in the example above. |

Enter negative for leading powerfactor (when kW and kvar have opposite signs.)<br>A positive power factor for a generator signifies that the generator produces vars <br>as is typical for a synchronous generator.  Induction machines would be <br>specified with a negative power factor. |

If the maximum control iterations are exceeded, and no numerical instability is seen in the EventLog of via monitors, then try increasing the value of this parameter to reduce the number of control iterations needed to achieve the control criteria, and move to the power flow solution. |

| 1 | bus1 | Name of bus to which the main terminal (1) is connected.<br>bus1=busname<br>bus1=busname.1.2.3<br><br>The VSOURCE object is a two-terminal voltage source (thevenin equivalent). Bus2 defaults to Bus1 with all phases connected to ground (node 0) unless previously specified. This is a Yg connection. If you want something different, define the Bus2 property ezplicitly. |
| 2 | basekv | Base Source kV, usually phase-phase (L-L) unless you are making a positive-sequence model or 1-phase modelin which case, it will be phase-neutral (L-N) kV. |
| 3 | pu | Per unit of the base voltage that the source is actually operating at.<br>"pu=1.05" |
| 4 | angle | Phase angle in degrees of first phase: e.g.,Angle=10.3 |

| 6 | phases | Number of phases.  Defaults to 3. |
| 7 | MVAsc3 | MVA Short circuit, 3-phase fault. Default = 2000. Z1 is determined by squaring the base kv and dividing by this value. For single-phase source, this value is not used. |
| 8 | MVAsc1 | MVA Short Circuit, 1-phase fault. Default = 2100. The "single-phase impedance", Zs, is determined by squaring the base kV and dividing by this value. Then Z0 is determined by Z0 = 3Zs - 2Z1.  For 1-phase sources, Zs is used directly. Use X0R0 to define X/R ratio for 1-phase source. |

Z1 MUST BE DEFINED TO USE THIS OPTION FOR DEFINING THE MATRIX.<br><br>Side Effect: Sets Z2 and Z0 to same values unless they were previously defined. |
| 21 | Z0 | Zero-sequence equivalent source impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: <br><br>Z0=[3, 4]  ! represents 3 + j4 <br><br>Used to define the impedance matrix of the VSOURCE if Z1 is also specified. <br><br>Note: Z0 defaults to Z1 if it is not specifically defined.  |

| 30 | Model | {Thevenin\* \| Ideal}  Specifies whether the Vsource is to be considered a Thevenin short circuit model or a quasi-ideal voltage source. If Thevenin, the Vsource uses the impedances defined for all calculations. If "Ideal", the model uses a small impedance on the diagonal of the impedance matrix for the fundamental base frequency power flow only. Then switches to actual Thevenin model for other frequencies.  |
